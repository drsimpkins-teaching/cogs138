# cogs138: Neural Data Science
Neural Data Science course taught by [Alex Simpkins](mailto:a@robotics.radiantdolphinpress.com) PhD at UCSD in Spring 2023.

The Teaching Assistant for this course was Siddhant Salvi, who was at the time a Masters Student at UCSD.

Here you will find files, repositories, lecture slides, readings and other files as linked to from the main website. This is also where final project repos will live, mirrored on the neuraldatascience organization site.

The most up to date syllabus information will be on the website, so in a conflict between website and pdf syllabus, please take the website as the priority document. [http://casimpkinsjr.radiantdolphinpress.com/pages/cogs138_sp23](http://casimpkinsjr.radiantdolphinpress.com/pages/cogs138_sp23)
