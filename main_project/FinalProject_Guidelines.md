## Project Overview

Your final project should integrate two (or more!) different datasets to address a question about brain function. For example, you could investigate specific cell types in the brain, combining information across different data sets of your choosing (e.g., gene expression, visual responses, connectivity, and/or intrinsic activity). Or you could choose one brain region in humans and integrate datasets of your choosing (e.g., gene expression, Neurosynth, LISC, Human Brain Project) to address the function of that brain region and identify possible links between genes, circuits, and behavior.

The broad objectives for the project are to:

* Identify questions that are addressable by publicly available datasets
* Integrate datasets to address a scientific question
* Implement the technical skills you’ve learned
* Work effectively with a team

To accomplish this you will work in teams of 4 to 5 students to conceive of and carry out an analysis project. You will find in your future careers the need to work on projects in groups frequently (even if you really, really, really, really don’t want to).

The basic project steps (broken down in more detail below):

- Find a real world dataset and problem that you believe can be solved with one or more of the data science techniques we have learned in class.
- Apply the techniques outlined and come up with a result for the dataset that you proposed.
- Assemble a Jupyter notebook that communicates your hypothesis, methods, and results. Submit this as your final project.
- Submit feedback about group and individual group members. This is done individually.

We strongly encourage you to discuss potential project ideas with your TAs and IAs, and/or with Prof. Voytek! This will give us a chance to make sure you’re on the right track even before you submit your draft.

## Advice

The main pieces of advice are:

* Start early
* Work consistently
* Be a good teammate
* Work as a team
* Seek advice when you are unsure, and see it early and often!
* Talk to your TA and Dr. Simpkins - we’re here to help!
* Choose a general interest domain and question of interest, and then choose a dataset, not vice versa. I promise it will go much better.
* Start early!!!!!

As far as resources go, it is okay to ask other teams what they are doing in terms of sources, presentation plans, and so on. As long as you are not using another team’s work and claiming it as your own, collaboration with classmates is encouraged. If you find a good source of datasets, please share with everyone on Piazza!

## Previous COGS 138 Final Projects

Previous projects can be viewed from when this course ran in [Winter 2021](https://github.com/NeuralDataScience/Projects). Note that these projects are of high quality and if you get inspiration or code from previous projects, this must be noted in your project, giving attribution to the former groups’ work.
